Quoted _Brian Spiering_ : <br>
Deep learning parser should be **sequence-based** (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)).
To apply Deep Learning, you'll need many thousands of examples with each section labeled. 
There is HR-XML (Human Resources - Extensible Markup Language) which are the industry standards for labels of resume sections.

Used **stacked bidirectional GRU/LSTM recurrent layers**

This approach was also compared with Convolutional layers, which are generally faster than recurrent layers, but recurrent layers have shown better accuracy.

We experimented with different vector embeddings including **fastText** and **custom Word2vec**. This helped us to significantly reduce the following:
- Dependency on the amount of labeled data
- Time needed model training

#### Topic modeling
- Used several unsupervised approaches for text clusterization by topics. 
- Particularly, we used **BigARTM** to resolve this problem because it showed better performance and accuracy when compared to other libraries such as Gensim.

## 6] Accurate software demo
| Personal info      | My comments      |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Name| Accurate becuz it's simple |
| Email, Phone | Accurate becuz it's simple (Regex) |
| Home Address | Segmented to designated fields. Detection of *country & states & postcodes* are accurate. Data enrichment is good (E.g. Convert Pulau Pinang to Penang) |
| URL | Able to differentiate social media domain such as LinkedIn |
| Gender | Gender prediction using picture provided |

| Educations     | My comments      |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
|Title|Accurate. E.g. Master of Science(Msc) |   
|Institution name| Can detect non-English| 
|course titles| Accurate|   
|Date start & ends| Inaccurate why?|

| Other headers     | My comments      |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Working experiences | Can't even process 'Research Fellow' or 'tutor'.|   
| Attachments  | Less useful | 
| Skills  | Accurate | 
| Languages  | Accurate | 
| Tasks  | Less useful |
