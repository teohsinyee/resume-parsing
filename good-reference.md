Quoted _Brian Spiering_ : <br>
Deep learning parser should be sequence-based (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)).
To apply Deep Learning, you'll need many thousands of examples with each section labeled. 
There is HR-XML (Human Resources - Extensible Markup Language) which are the industry standards for labels of resume sections.
